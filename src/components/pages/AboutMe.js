            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Brett Santor and I am a graduate from University of California Berkeley extensions Full Stack Bootcamp! I have been building applications with the MERN stack and have a solid foundation of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I love to expand my knowledge and taking challenges head on. I have developed a strong work ethic from working in construction for 15 years. During this time I have learned how to over come obstacles in an efficient and timely manner. This has also given me the experience in leading teams to complete projects on a schedule and to industry standards. I love to build which is what sparked my interest in coding and I am enjoying drawing the parallels between the two. I take pride in what I do and love work on challenging projects.</p>
